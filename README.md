# XFuscator-Cleaner
a tool will clean [XFuscator](https://github.com/efrederickson/XFuscator) and will deobfuscate if need replace all data it moved in another array (old and new one)

## spoiler alert
better to know this will now print out of load or load string this is cleaner for array replace so it's up to you extract code
its easy as fuck to extract code if you know a little lua

## Usage	
- Put extracted code inside input.lua
- enter command to run
```bash
node index.js
```
